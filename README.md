# Project Overview
_From Udacity team_
In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

# What I have done

1. Wrote the RSS feed test suite to check:
		- that the all feeds array is not empty
		- that the feeds individual url field is not empty
		- that the feeds individual name field is not empty

2. Wrote the menu test suite to check:
		- that the menu by default is hidden
		- that the menu toggle being seen when clicked

3. Wrote the initial entry test suite to check:
		- that the feeds actually load

4. Wrote the new feed selection test suite to check:
		that the new feed selected updates, and is not the same as the first one
